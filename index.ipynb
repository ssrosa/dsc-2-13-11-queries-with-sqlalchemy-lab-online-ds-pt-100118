    "# Querying with SQLAlchemy - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn how to use SQLAlchemy to write queries about Microsoft's _Northwind Traders_ database!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read and understand an ERD diagram\n",
    "* Create queries with SQLAlchemy, including queries that involve many-to-many relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this lab, we'll need to download a SQLite3-compatible version of the _Northwind Traders_ database from Microsoft.  Microsoft built this database back in the year 2000 to help showcase their SQL Server technology. Since then, it has been open-sourced and has become a great practice tool for every new generation of SQL learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us, some generous programmers have already converted the Northwind database to a sqlite-compatible version and posted it on Github. We've already included the file the SQL database file that we'll be working with in the repo for this folder, along with the following ERD Diagram. However, if you would like to work with the larger version of this dataset at a future time, just clone [this repo](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3) and follow their instructions to access it!\n",
    "\n",
    "## ERD Diagram For Northwind Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "The following ERD Diagram describes the Northwind Traders Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='Northwind_ERD.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the text seems a bit hard to read inside this jupyter notebook, just go into the folder for this repo and open the `Northwind_ERD.png` file manually to see it full size. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll need to do is connect to the Northwind Traders database, which can be found in the file `Northwind_small.sqlite`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, import the necessary tools from the `sqlalchemy` library, and take the necessary steps to connect to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** We won't be modifying the information in the database at all, just querying it, so there's no need to import the various things you would need to create declarative base classes and the like."

    "One of the most useful things we can do when working with a new database is to inspect the tables until we have a solid idea of what we're looking at.  As you work through this lab, you'll notice that there are some small discrepancies between the Table/Column names listed in the ERD and what they are actually are in the database.  This may be annoying, but this is not an accident--sometimes, documentation is wrong!  By learning how to inspect what tables exist in a database, as well as how which columns exist inside a table, we can save ourselves a lot of headaches by double checking. \n",

    "## Using SQLAlchemy Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've just been using SQLAlchemy as a way to connect to a database and run SQL queries. However, SQLAlchemy is an **_Object-Relational Mapper_**, and can map entities in our database to python objects! This can be incredibly helpful when we need to incorporate data from our database into an object-oriented program or model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by getting some practice with `session` objects, because that's where all the magic happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.query` Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we created a `session` object at the beginning of this lab by using SQLAlchemy's `sessionmaker` function and binding it to our `engine` object.  We haven't used our `session` object too much thus far, but now we'll use it for queries!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `session` object contains a `.query()` method which returns a query object containing the results of our query, with the results mapped to objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can make use of Object-Relational Mappings, we need to make sure that we have mappings created that map the tables in our existing database to objects in python.  We don't want to have to do this manually, so we'll make use the `automap` module inside of `sqlalchemy.ext`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import `MetaData` from `sqlalchemy`\n",
    "* Import `automap_base` from `sqlalchemy.ext.automap`\n",
    "* Create a `MetaData` object\n",
    "* Use the metadata object's `reflect` method on our `engine`\n",
    "* Call `automap_base` and set the `metadata` parameter to our `metadata`. Store the results returned inside of the variable `Base`\n",
    "* Call `base.prepare()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Map `Employee` and `Customer` to the `Employee` and `Customer` classes, which can be found inside of `Base.classes`"

Note that there are many, many more awesome things that SQLAlchemy can do, but they're outside the scope of this lesson.  However, if you're interested in learning more, don't be afraid to take a look at the [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html) and work through some tutorials in your spare time!"
